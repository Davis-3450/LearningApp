# LearningApp

This is a leaning app for the bolt.new hackaton

backend : fastapi
frontend : react/nextjs
database : None for now

we will make a deck system where the user can create a deck of cards and then learn them based on any topic they want.

We will have a generic deck system where each deck can be preseted on different interfaces like in duolingo.

We will have: 

- Anki like cards
- Flashcards like for vocabulary
- Quiz like for multiple choice
- Matching game
- Word search
- Word scramble
- Word unscrambler
- Word jumbles
- Word unscrambler

The deck model will be contained on a json schema with multiple fields so each question can be represented in different ways, variations or interfaces.s

We will have a separate mode for soroban like math challenges with a graphical interface (this wont use AI for bovious)
