# AI Generation Feature - Setup & Usage Guide

## ✅ Implementation Status

**COMPLETED**: The AI generation feature has been successfully implemented and all build issues have been resolved.

## 🚀 What was implemented

### 1. Backend API Endpoint (`/api/ai/generate`)
- **Location**: `apps/frontend/src/app/api/ai/generate/route.ts`
- **Features**:
  - OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo integration
  - Robust error handling with specific error types
  - Schema validation using Zod
  - Automatic deck storage via `deckStore`
  - Graceful fallbacks for storage failures

### 2. Frontend UI (`/decks/ai-generate`)
- **Location**: `apps/frontend/src/app/decks/ai-generate/page.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - User-friendly form for AI generation requests
  - Loading states and disabled controls during generation
  - Comprehensive error handling with specific feedback
  - Toast notifications for different error types
  - Automatic navigation to generated deck

### 3. Enhanced Deck Store
- **Location**: `apps/frontend/src/lib/deck-store.ts`
- **Improvements**:
  - Lazy initialization (no filesystem access during build)
  - Client-side environment detection
  - Graceful error handling for missing directories
  - Automatic disk persistence when possible

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables

Create `apps/frontend/.env.local`:

```env
# OpenAI API Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_openai_api_key_here
```

**Get your API key**: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

### 2. Install Dependencies (Already Done)

```bash
# OpenAI dependency is already installed
npm install # or bun install
```

### 3. Build & Run

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Or start production
npm run start
```

## 📝 Usage Guide

### For Users

1. **Navigate to AI Generation**:
   - Go to `/decks/ai-generate`
   - Or use the "AI Generate" button from any deck page

2. **Fill the Form**:
   - **Topic** (required): Describe what you want to learn
   - **Description** (optional): Additional context or requirements
   - **Difficulty**: Choose beginner, intermediate, or advanced
   - **Concept Count**: Select 5-20 concepts

3. **Generate & Study**:
   - Click "Generate with AI"
   - Wait for processing (typically 10-30 seconds)
   - Automatically redirected to the new deck

### For Developers

#### API Usage

```typescript
// Example API call
const response = await fetch('/api/ai/generate', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    topic: 'JavaScript Fundamentals',
    description: 'Focus on ES6+ features',
    conceptCount: 10
  })
});

const result = await response.json();
if (result.success) {
  console.log('Generated deck:', result.data);
}
```

#### Response Format

```typescript
// Success Response
{
  success: true,
  data: {
    fileName: "javascript-fundamentals",
    deck: {
      id: "uuid",
      title: "JavaScript Fundamentals",
      description: "...",
      concepts: [
        {
          conceptType: "term",
          term: "Arrow Functions",
          definition: "...",
          variations?: [
            { type: "example", text: "..." },
            { type: "fun-fact", text: "..." }
          ]
        }
      ],
      version: 1
    }
  },
  message: "Deck generated and saved successfully"
}

// Error Response
{
  success: false,
  error: "Failed to generate deck: [specific error]"
}
```

## 🛡️ Security Features

### API Key Protection
- Environment variable stored server-side only
- Never exposed to client
- Build-time validation

### Input Validation
- Zod schema validation for all inputs
- Sanitized filename generation
- Topic length limits (1-200 characters)
- Concept count limits (3-20)

### Error Handling
- Rate limit detection and user feedback
- API key validation
- JSON parsing error handling
- Schema validation with helpful messages

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Directory Structure
```
apps/frontend/
├── src/app/api/ai/generate/route.ts     # AI API endpoint
├── src/app/decks/ai-generate/page.tsx   # UI for generation
├── src/lib/
│   ├── api/decks.ts                     # API client methods
│   └── deck-store.ts                    # Local storage management
└── .env.local                           # Environment variables
```

### Data Flow
1. User submits generation form
2. Frontend validates and sends request to `/api/ai/generate`
3. Backend validates API key and request
4. OpenAI generates structured JSON response
5. Response validated against Deck schema
6. Deck saved to local storage
7. User redirected to new deck

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "OpenAI API key not configured"**
- Ensure `.env.local` exists with correct API key
- Restart development server after adding variables

**2. "API rate limit exceeded"**
- You've hit OpenAI's rate limits
- Wait a few minutes before trying again
- Consider upgrading your OpenAI plan

**3. "Generated content does not match expected format"**
- OpenAI occasionally returns malformed JSON
- The system will ask you to try again
- Usually resolves on retry

**4. Build errors about missing modules**
- Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
- Check that OpenAI package is in package.json

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by adding to `.env.local`:
```env
NODE_ENV=development
```

## 📊 Performance & Costs

### OpenAI API Costs
- **Model**: GPT-4 Turbo
- **Average cost per generation**: ~$0.02-0.05
- **Typical response time**: 10-30 seconds

### Optimization Features
- Efficient prompting for consistent results
- Minimal token usage with structured prompts
- Caching disabled in development for testing

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

### Vercel Deployment
1. Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in Vercel environment variables
2. Deploy as normal - no special configuration needed
3. Deck storage will work in-memory (not persisted between deployments)

### For Production Storage
Consider replacing `deckStore` with:
- Database integration (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- Cloud storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage)
- Vercel KV or similar key-value store

## 🔄 Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- [ ] Custom prompt templates
- [ ] Multiple AI model options (Claude, Gemini)
- [ ] Batch generation
- [ ] Image generation for concepts
- [ ] Community sharing of AI-generated decks

### Integration Possibilities
- Learning analytics
- Spaced repetition scheduling
- Progress tracking
- Social features
